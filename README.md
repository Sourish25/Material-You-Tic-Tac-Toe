## 🎮 Game Modes

This isn't just your grandmother's Tic Tac Toe. Explore **10 distinct game modes**:

1.  **Classic**: The traditional 3x3 grid you know and love.
2.  **Ultimate**: The complex 9x9 nested strategy game. Win local grids to capture the cell in the global board.
3.  **Gravity**: A "Connect 4" style twist where pieces fall to the lowest available slot in the column.
4.  **Fog of War**: The board is hidden! Cells are revealed only when you or your opponent plays near them.
5.  **Bomb**: Watch out! 15% chance for a move to explode, clearing surrounding cells.
6.  **Speed**: Think fast! A countdown timer forces quick decisions. Run out of time and lose your turn.
7.  **Blocked**: Start the game with random cells already "dead" and unplayable.
8.  **Chaos**: 10% chance that your piece will flip to your opponent's symbol when placed. Pure anarchy.
9.  **Fading**: Old moves fade away after a few turns, constantly changing the board state.
10. **Misere**: The goal is to **lose**. Force your opponent to make a line of 3 to win.
